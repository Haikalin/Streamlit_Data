Brazilian E-Commerce Analysis By Haikal Assyauqi

This is a project that I did for IDCamp Data Analysis, this project is about analyzing Brazilian E-Commerce data. The data that I used in this project is from Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce platform. The data contains information about orders, customers, products, and sellers. The data is from 2016 to 2018. Even though there is 8 table in this dataset, I only use 4 tables which are orders, customers, order_items, and products. The goal of this project is to analyze the data and find insights.
